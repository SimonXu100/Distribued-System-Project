# Primary/Backup Key/Value Service

### Introduction

In the MapReduce assignment handling failures is relatively easy
because the workers don't maintain state. The master does maintain
state, but you didn't have to make the master fault tolerant. This
assignment is a first step towards making stateful servers fault tolerant.


### Overview
In this part you'll make a key/value service fault-tolerant
using a form of primary/backup replication. In order to ensure that
all parties (clients and servers) agree on which server is the
primary, and which is the backup, we'll introduce a kind of master
server, called the viewservice. The viewservice monitors whether each
available server is alive or dead. If the current primary or backup
becomes dead, the viewservice selects a server to replace it. A client
checks with the viewservice to find the current primary. The servers
cooperate with the viewservice to ensure that at most one primary is
active at a time.

Your key/value service will allow replacement of failed servers. If
the primary fails, the viewservice will promote the backup to be
primary. If the backup fails, or is promoted, and there is an idle
server available, the viewservice will cause it to be the backup.
The primary will send its complete database to the new backup,
and then send subsequent Puts to the backup to ensure that the
backup's key/value database remains identical to the primary's.

It turns out that the primary must send Gets as well as Puts to the backup
(if there is one), and must wait for the backup to reply before
responding to the client. This helps prevent two servers from acting
as primary (a "split brain"). An example: S1 is the primary and S2 is
the backup. The viewservice decides (incorrectly) that S1 is dead,
and promotes S2 to be primary. If a client thinks that S1 is still the
primary and sends it an operation, S1 will forward the operation to
S2, and S2 will reply with an error indicating that it is no longer
the backup (assuming S2 obtained the new view from the viewservice).
S1 can then return an error to the client indicating that S1 might no
longer be the primary (reasoning that, since S2 rejected the
operation, a new view must have been formed); the client can then ask
the viewservice for the correct primary (S2) and send it the
operation.

A failed key/value server may restart, but it will do so without a
copy of the replicated data (i.e. the keys and values). That is, your
key/value server will keep the data in memory, not on disk. One
consequence of keeping data only in memory is that if there's no
backup, and the primary fails, and then restarts, it cannot then act
as primary.

Only RPC may be used for interaction between clients and servers,
between different servers, and between different clients. For example,
different instances of your server are not allowed to share Go
variables or files.

The design outlined in the assignment has some fault-tolerance and
performance limitations:

We will address these limitations in later assignments by using better
designs and protocols. This assignment will make you understand what
the tricky issues are so that you can design better design/protocols.
Also, parts of this assignment's design (e.g., a separate view
service) are uncommon in practice.

The primary/backup scheme in this assignment is not based on any
published protocol. In fact, this assignment doesn't specify a
complete protocol; you must flesh out the protocol. The protocol has
similarities with Flat Datacenter Storage (the viewservice is like
FDS's metadata server, and the primary/backup servers are like FDS's
tractservers), though FDS pays far more attention to performance.
It's also a bit like a MongoDB replica set (though MongoDB selects the
leader with a Paxos-like election). For a detailed description of a
(different) primary-backup-like protocol, see [Chain
Replication](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/osdi04.pdf).
Chain Replication has higher performance than this assignment's
design, though it assumes that the viewservice never declares a
server dead when it is merely partitioned. See Harp and Viewstamped
Replication for a detailed treatment of high-performance
primary/backup and reconstruction of system state after various kinds
of failures.

### Software

Do a <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest assignment software. We supply you
with new skeleton code and new tests in <tt>src/viewservice</tt> and
<tt>src/pbservice</tt>.

```bash
$ cd ~/4113
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/viewservice
$ go test
2012/12/28 14:51:47 method Kill has wrong number of ins: 1
First primary: --- FAIL: Test1 (1.02 seconds)

```

Ignore the <tt>method Kill</tt> error message now and in the future.
Our test code fails because <tt>viewservice/server.go</tt> has empty
RPC handlers.

You can run your code as stand-alone programs using the source in
<tt>main/viewd.go</tt>,
<tt>main/pbd.go</tt>, and
<tt>main/pbc.go</tt>.
See the comments in <tt>pbc.go</tt>.

### Part A: The Viewservice

First you'll implement a viewservice and make sure it passes our tests; in
Part B you'll build the key/value service. Your viewservice won't itself be
replicated, so it will be relatively straightforward. Part B is _much_ harder than
part A, because the K/V service is replicated and you have to flesh out the
replication protocol.

The viewservice goes through a sequence of numbered
_views_, each with a primary and (if possible) a backup.
A view consists of a view number and the identity (network port name) of
the view's primary and backup servers.

The primary in a view must always be either the primary
or the backup of the previous view. This helps ensure
that the key/value service's state is preserved.
An exception: when the viewservice first starts, it should
accept any server at all as the first primary.
The backup in a view can be any server (other than the primary),
or can be altogether missing if no server is available
(represented by an empty string, <tt>""</tt>).

Each key/value server should send a Ping RPC once per 
<tt>PingInterval</tt>
(see <tt>viewservice/common.go</tt>).
The viewservice replies to the Ping with a description of the current
view. A Ping lets the viewservice know that the key/value
server is alive; informs the key/value server of the current
view; and informs the viewservice of the most recent view
that the key/value server knows about.
If the viewservice doesn't receive a Ping from a server
for <tt>DeadPings</tt> <tt>PingInterval</tt>s, the
viewservice should consider the server to be dead.
When a server re-starts after a crash, it should send
one or more Pings with an argument of zero to inform
the viewservice that it has crashed (of course, duplicate
<tt>Ping(0)</tt> calls will be interpreted as repeated
crashes).

The viewservice proceeds to a new view when either it hasn't
received a Ping from the primary or backup for <tt>DeadPings</tt>
<tt>PingInterval</tt>s, or
if the primary or backup crashed and restarted, or
if there is no backup and there's an idle server
(a server that's been Pinging but is
neither the primary nor the backup).
But the viewservice must **not** change views (i.e., return
a different view to callers) until 
the primary from the current view acknowledges
that it is operating in the current view (by sending
a Ping with the current view number). If the viewservice has not yet
received an acknowledgment for the current view from the primary of
the current view, the viewservice should not change views even if it
thinks that the primary or backup has died.

The acknowledgment rule prevents the viewservice from getting more than one
view ahead of the key/value servers. If the viewservice could get arbitrarily
far ahead, then it would need a more complex design in which it kept a history
of views, allowed key/value servers to ask about old views, and
garbage-collected information about old views when appropriate. The downside of
the acknowledgement rule is that if the primary fails before it acknowledges the
view in which it is primary, then the viewservice cannot change views, spins
forever, and cannot make forward progress.

An example sequence of view changes:

![](lab-2a-vs.png)

The above example is overspecified; for example, when the view server
gets <tt>Ping(1)</tt> from S1 for the first time, it is also OK for it
to return view 1, as long as it eventually switches to view 2 (which
includes S2).

We provide you with a complete <tt>client.go</tt> and
appropriate RPC definitions in <tt>common.go</tt>.
Your job is to supply the needed code in <tt>server.go</tt>.
When you're done, you should pass all the <tt>viewservice</tt>
tests:

```bash
$ cd ~/4113/src/viewservice
$ go test
Test: First primary ...
 ... Passed
Test: First backup ...
 ... Passed
Test: Backup takes over if primary fails ...
 ... Passed
Test: Restarted server becomes backup ...
 ... Passed
Test: Idle third server becomes backup if primary fails ...
 ... Passed
Test: Restarted primary treated as dead ...
 ... Passed
Test: Viewserver waits for primary to ack view ...
 ... Passed
Test: Uninitialized server can't become primary ...
 ... Passed
PASS
ok   viewservice   7.457s
```

The above output omits some benign Go RPC errors.

Hint: you'll want to add field(s) to <tt>ViewServer</tt> in
<tt>server.go</tt> in order to keep track of the most recent
time at which the viewservice has heard a Ping from each
server. Perhaps a <tt>map</tt> from server names to
<tt>time.Time</tt>. You can find the current time with <tt>time.Now()</tt>.

Hint: add field(s) to <tt>ViewServer</tt> to keep track of the
current view.

Hint: you'll need to keep track of whether the primary for the
current view has acknowledged it (in PingArgs.Viewnum).

Hint: your viewservice needs to make periodic decisions, for
example to promote the backup if the viewservice has missed <tt>DeadPings</tt>
pings from the primary. Add this code to the <tt>tick()</tt>
function, which is called once per <tt>PingInterval</tt>.

Hint: there may be more than two servers sending Pings. The
extra ones (beyond primary and backup) are volunteering
to be backup if needed.

Hint: the viewservice needs a way to detect that a primary
or backup has failed and re-started. For example, the primary
may crash and quickly restart without missing sending a
single Ping.

Hint: study the test cases before you start programming. If you fail a
test, you may have to look at the test code in <tt>test_test.go</tt> to figure
out what the failure scenario is.

The easiest way to track down bugs is to insert log.Printf()
statements, collect the output in a file with <tt>go test &gt;
out</tt>, and then think about whether the output matches your
understanding of how your code should behave. The last step is most important.

Remember that the Go RPC server framework starts a new thread for each
received RPC request. Thus if multiple RPCs arrive at the same time
(from multiple clients), there may be multiple threads running
concurrently in the server.

The tests kills a server by setting its <tt>dead</tt> flag. You must
make sure that your server terminates correctly when that flag is set, otherwise
you may fail to complete the test cases.



### Part B: The primary/backup key/value service

Your key/value service should continue operating correctly as long as
there has never been a time at which no server was alive. It should
also operate correctly with partitions: a server that suffers from
temporary network failure without crashing, or can talk to some
computers but not others. If your service is operating with just one
server, it should be able to incorporate a recovered or idle server
(as backup), so that it can then tolerate another server failure.

Correct operation means that calls to Clerk.Get(k) return the latest
value set by a successful call to Clerk.Put(k,v) or
Clerk.PutHash(k,v), or an empty string if the key has never been
Put()'ed. All operations should provide at-most-once semantic.

You should assume that the viewservice never halts or crashes. 

Your clients and servers may only communicate using RPC, and both
clients and servers must
send RPCs with the <tt>call()</tt> function in <tt>client.go</tt>.

It's crucial that only one primary be active at any given time. You
should have a clear story worked out for why that's the case for your
design. A danger: suppose in some view S1 is the primary; the viewservice changes
views so that S2 is the primary; but S1 hasn't yet heard about the new
view and thinks it is still primary. Then some clients might talk to
S1, and others talk to S2, and not see each other's Put()s.

A server that isn't the active primary should either not respond to
clients, or respond with an error: it should set GetReply.Err or
PutReply.Err to something other than OK.

Clerk.Get(), Clerk.Put(), and Clerk.PutHash() should only return when they
have completed the operation. That is, Puts should keep trying until it has
updated the key/value database, and Clerk.Get() should keep trying until it has
retrieved the current value for the key (if any). Your server must filter out
the duplicate RPCs that these client re-tries will generate to ensure
at-most-once semantics for operations. You can assume that each clerk has only
one outstanding Put or Get. Think carefully about what the commit point is for
a Put.

A server should not talk to the viewservice for every Put/Get
it receives, since that would put the viewservice on the critical path
for performance and fault-tolerance. Instead servers should
Ping the viewservice periodically
(in <tt>pbservice/server.go</tt>'s <tt>tick()</tt>)
to learn about new views.

Part of your one-primary-at-a-time strategy should rely on the
viewservice only promoting the backup from view _i_
to be primary in view _i+1_. If the old primary from
view _i_ tries to handle a client request, it will
forward it to its backup. If that backup hasn't heard about
view _i+1_, then it's not acting as primary yet, so
no harm done. If the backup has heard about view _i+1_
and is acting as primary, it knows enough to reject the old
primary's forwarded client requests.

You'll need to ensure that the backup sees every update to the
key/value database, by a combination of the primary initializing it with
the complete key/value database and forwarding subsequent
client Puts.

The skeleton code for the key/value servers is in <tt>src/pbservice</tt>.
It uses your viewservice, so you'll have to set up
your <tt>GOPATH</tt> as follows:

```bash
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/4113
$ cd ~/4113/src/pbservice
$ go test -i
$ go test
Single primary, no backup: --- FAIL: TestBasicFail (2.00 seconds)
    test_test.go:50: first primary never formed view
--- FAIL: TestFailPut (5.55 seconds)
    test_test.go:165: wrong primary or backup
Concurrent Put()s to the same key: --- FAIL: TestConcurrentSame (8.51 seconds)
...
Partition an old primary: --- FAIL: TestPartition (3.52 seconds)
    test_test.go:354: wrong primary or backup
...
```

Here's a recommended plan of attack:

You're done if you can pass all the <tt>pbservice</tt> tests:
```bash
$ cd ~/4113/src/pbservice
$ go test
Test: Single primary, no backup ...
 ... Passed
Test: Add a backup ...
 ... Passed
Test: Primary failure ...
 ... Passed
Test: Kill last server, new one should not be active ...
 ... Passed
Test: at-most-once Put; unreliable ...
 ... Passed
Test: Put() immediately after backup failure ...
 ... Passed
Test: Put() immediately after primary failure ...
 ... Passed
Test: Concurrent Put()s to the same key ...
 ... Passed
Test: Concurrent Put()s to the same key; unreliable ...
 ... Passed
Test: Repeated failures/restarts ...
 ... Put/Gets done ... 
 ... Passed
Test: Repeated failures/restarts; unreliable ...
 ... Put/Gets done ... 
 ... Passed
Test: Old primary does not serve Gets ...
 ... Passed
Test: Partitioned old primary does not complete Gets ...
 ... Passed
PASS
ok   pbservice    113.352s
```

You'll see some "method Kill has wrong number of ins" complaints
and lots of "rpc: client protocol error" and "rpc: writing response"
complaints; ignore them.

Hint: you'll probably need to create new RPCs to forward client
requests from primary to backup, since the backup should reject
a direct client request but should accept a forwarded request.

Hint: you'll probably need to create new RPCs to handle the transfer
of the complete key/value database from the primary to a new backup.
You can send the whole database in one RPC (for example,
include a <tt>map[string]string</tt> in the RPC arguments).

Hint: the state to filter duplicates must be replicated along with the key/value
state.

Hint: the tester arranges for RPC replies to be lost in tests whose
description includes "unreliable". This will cause RPCs to be executed
by the receiver, but since the sender sees no reply, it cannot
tell whether the server executed the RPC.

You may find you want to generate numbers that have
a high probability of being unique. Try this:
```go
 import "crypto/rand"
 import "math/big"
 func nrand() int64 {
  max := big.NewInt(int64(1) << 62)
  bigx, _ := rand.Int(rand.Reader, max)
  x := bigx.Int64()
  return x
 }
```

The tests kills a server by setting its <tt>dead</tt> flag. You must
make sure that your server terminates correctly when that flag is set, otherwise
you may fail to complete the test cases.

Hint: even if your viewserver passed all the tests in Part A, it
may still have bugs that cause failures in Part B.

Hint: study the test cases before you start programming
